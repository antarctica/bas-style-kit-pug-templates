### Before release

1. create a release branch
2. remove `-develop` from the version in:
  * `package.json`
  * `docker-compose.yml`
  * `layouts/bas-style-kit/blank.pug`:
    * `bsk_variables.templates_version`
3. push the app docker image [1]
4. if new config options have been set, update the usage section
6. close release in changelog
7. commit changes, merge with master and tag with new version
8. push the merged release to NPM [2]

**Note:** If the BAS Style Kit version changes, make sure to bump that version in `layouts/bas-style-kit/blank.pug` too.

### Publishing NPM package

To preview the contents of the NPM package:

```shell
# Add `entrypoint: ash` and comment out the `command` parameter of the 'app' service in docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose run app
$ ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js archive
$ npm pack
# Undo changes made to docker-compose.yml
```

**Note:** This project includes a `.npmignore` file to exclude additional files from NPM packages.

```shell
# Add `entrypoint: ash` and comment out the `command` parameter of the 'app' service in docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose run app
$ ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js archive

# Undo changes made to docker-compose.yml
```
